# Decoding the Ethereum Stamp in Your Gitcoin Passport: An In-Depth Guide

## 1. What is the Ethereum Stamp?

The Ethereum stamp within your Gitcoin Passport is a sophisticated marker of your active participation on the Ethereum mainnet. It's designed not just to identify Sybil entities but also to recognize varying levels of user engagement. If you haven't received credentials under this stamp, it doesn't label you as Sybil. Instead, it indicates that the model currently does not have enough data to verify a higher level of engagement. It's important to note that continued authentic and diverse interaction with the Ethereum network can provide the necessary signals for the model to qualify your activities for a stamp in the future.

## 2. How the Ethereum Stamp Operates

The stamp uses a binary classification model to assess your Ethereum transactions. This process involves analyzing your transaction patterns, smart contract interactions, and overall network participation to determine the stamp you receive.\


## 3. Criteria for Receiving an Ethereum Stamp

To qualify for an Ethereum stamp, your active participation on the Ethereum mainnet is crucial. This includes executing transactions, engaging with smart contracts, and general involvement in Ethereum-based activities.

## 4. Activity Reflection on the Stamp

Your Ethereum stamp encapsulates various aspects of your blockchain activities, such as transaction frequency and types, smart contract involvement, and other relevant interactions, providing a comprehensive picture of your engagement.

## 5. Stamp Validity and Renewal Process

Each Ethereum stamp you earn remains valid for 90 days. After this period, you need to reclaim the stamp, potentially subject to reassessment by an updated model version. This could result in different stamp levels based on your recent activity.

## 6. Levels of the Ethereum Stamp

* ETH Enthusiast: Represents initial and growing engagement in the Ethereum network.
* ETH Pionier: Indicates a deeper, more consistent level of involvement.
* ETH Maxi: The highest level, signifying substantial contributions and active participation in the Ethereum community.

## 7. Influence on Passport Credibility

Your stamp level contributes significantly to the credibility of your Gitcoin Passport. A higher level indicates stronger and more authentic engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## 8. Enhancing Your Ethereum Stamp

To improve your Ethereum stamp, engage authentically and diversely within the Ethereum network. Regular transactions, contributions to smart contracts, and active community involvement are key factors.

## 9. Maintaining Your Stamp Level

Consistent engagement in Ethereum activities is essential. A reduction in activity can lead to a downgrade of your stamp level.

## 10. Underlying Model Mechanics

The stamp assessment utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and feature importance analysis. The model is updated periodically to maintain its effectiveness and accuracy.

## 11. Stamp Update Cycle

Your Ethereum stamp is updated regularly, ensuring it accurately reflects your most recent activities on the Ethereum network.
