# Decoding the Ethereum Stamp in Your Gitcoin Passport: An In-Depth Guide

## 1. What is the Ethereum Stamp?

The Ethereum stamp within your Gitcoin Passport is a sophisticated marker of your active participation on the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1). It's designed to identify both Sybil entities while also varying levels of user engagement. If you haven't received credentials under this stamp, it doesn't label you as Sybil or bot. Instead, it indicates that the model currently does not have enough data to verify a higher level of engagement. It's important to note that continued authentic and diverse interaction with the Ethereum network can provide the necessary signals for the model to qualify your activities for a stamp in the future.

## 2. How the Ethereum Stamp Operates

The stamp uses a Gitcoin Passport built binary classification model to assess your Ethereum transactions. This process involves analyzing your transaction patterns, smart contract interactions, and overall network participation to determine the stamp you receive. This is trained against a large dataset of Ethereum addresses that contains both known Sybil bad actors and known human good actors.

## 3. Criteria for Receiving an Ethereum Stamp

To qualify for an Ethereum stamp, your active participation on the Ethereum mainnet is crucial. This includes executing transactions, engaging with smart contracts, and general involvement in Ethereum-based activities.

## 4. Activity Reflection on the Stamp

Your Ethereum stamp encapsulates various aspects of your blockchain activities, such as transaction frequency and types, smart contract involvement, and other relevant interactions, providing a comprehensive picture of your engagement.

## 5. Stamp Validity and Renewal Process

Each Ethereum stamp you earn remains valid for 90 days. After this period, you need to reclaim the stamp, potentially subject to reassessment by an updated model version. This could result in different stamp levels based on your recent activity.

## 6. Levels of the Ethereum Stamp

Each of the following is a separate credential that you can obtain with the ETH stamp. These are increasing in the level and quality of activity that is returned by the model. Each higher level includes additional points. If you have level 2 “Pioneer” you will get the points for both Enthusiast and Pioneer. If you have Maxi you will obtain the points for all 4 levels:

* **ETH Enthusiast:** Represents initial and growing engagement in the Ethereum network.
* **ETH Pioneer:** A step up, reflecting ongoing commitment and active participation in Ethereum's growth.
* **ETH Advocate:** Indicates a deeper, more consistent level of involvement.

## 7. Influence on Passport Credibility

Your stamp level contributes significantly to the credibility of your Gitcoin Passport. A higher level indicates stronger and more authentic engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## 8. Enhancing Your Ethereum Stamp

To improve your Ethereum stamp, engage authentically and diversely within the Ethereum network. Regular transactions, contributions to smart contracts, and active community involvement are key factors.

## 9. Maintaining Your Stamp Level

Consistent engagement in Ethereum activities is essential. A reduction in activity can lead to a downgrade of your stamp level.

## 10. Underlying Model Mechanics

The stamp assessment utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, to examine all of the activity by each address. This model includes over 55 different features to determine the score. A feature represents a type of activity such as total transactions or the number of NFTs held by the address. The model is updated periodically to maintain its effectiveness and accuracy.

## 11. Stamp Update Cycle

Your Ethereum stamp is updated regularly, ensuring it accurately reflects your most recent activities on the Ethereum network.

## 12. Addressing Stamp Accuracy Concerns

If you have concerns about the accuracy of your Ethereum stamp, you can reach out to the support team with detailed information about your Ethereum activities for further assistance.

## Conclusion

The Ethereum stamp in your Gitcoin Passport is a sophisticated tool that dynamically mirrors your engagement and contributions to the Ethereum blockchain. It evolves with your activity, providing a credible indicator of your involvement to the wider community.
