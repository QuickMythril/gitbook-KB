### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the process, Gitcoin offers support through a chat window located at the bottom right corner of the page on the Gitcoin website, as well as on many product pages. Alternatively, you can seek assistance via Gitcoin's Discord channel.

### FAQ:

* **Why did I successfully claim the stamp but the score was not added?**\
  When attempting to claim a stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen if you already verified the same Linkedin account on a different Passport wallet. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified stamp to expire. Each stamp has a 90-day expiration.
