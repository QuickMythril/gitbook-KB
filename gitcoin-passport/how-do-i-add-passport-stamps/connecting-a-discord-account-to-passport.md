### FAQ:

* **Why did I successfully claim the stamp but the score was not added?**\
  The Gitcoin Passport scoring system is designed to recognize unique wallet addresses for stamp claims. If a stamp is claimed with the same Discord account across multiple wallets, only the initial claim will contribute to your score. This policy is in place to ensure fairness and to prevent the system from being exploited. To accrue points on a different wallet, you must wait for the current stamp's 90-day validity to expire. See [here](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/common-questions/why-is-my-passport-score-not-adding-up) for more information.
