### FAQs

1. **I get the message saying ‚ÄúYou are missing verifications: BrightID‚Äù, what does this mean?**\
   It means you need to first obtain a verification on BrightID before you can connect to your Passport. See [here](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/verifications) for how to obtain a BrightID verification
2. **I successfully verified the stamp but no score was added**\
   When attempting to claim a stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen if you already verified the same BrightID account on a different Passport wallet. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified stamp to expire. Each stamp has a 90-day expiration.
