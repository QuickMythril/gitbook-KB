## Prerequisites

*   An ENS address held on the wallet address associated with your Gitcoin Passport.

* The ENS must be set as your primary name.

## How to verify your ENS account

Ensure that you are eligible for the stamp by browsing to [https://app.ens.domains/](https://app.ens.domains/).&#x20;

Input your wallet address in the search field and press enter.

If you get a result like this where No primary name is set, or no names are found, you need to set your ens domain name as your primary domain. For information on how to set your primary name,  Please refer to [this help article from ENS](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7890756-the-primary-name).

Please note that ENS subdomains are not eligible for the ENS stamp.

### FAQ:

* Why did I successfully claim the stamp but the score was not added?\
  When attempting to claim a stamp using more than one wallet address, the score associated with subsequent wallet addresses will not be added. It can happen in cases where the ENS domain was previously owned by a user who already claimed the ENS stamp with it. In order to obtain points in a different wallet, you will have to wait for the verified stamp to expire. Each stamp has a 90-day expiration.
