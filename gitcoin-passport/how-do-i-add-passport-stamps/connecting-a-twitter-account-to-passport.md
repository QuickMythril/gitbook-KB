### FAQ:

* Why did I successfully claim the stamp but the score was not added?\
  Gitcoin Passport's scoring mechanism is designed to award scores based on unique wallet addresses. If you claim a stamp with the same Twitter account across multiple wallets, only the first claim will affect your score. This policy is intended to maintain the integrity of the scoring system. To accrue points on another wallet, you must wait for the current stamp's 90-day validity period to expire. See [here](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/common-questions/why-is-my-passport-score-not-adding-up) for more information.
