# üîå Guide to Add Proof of Humanity account to Passport

This guide is designed to help you link your Proof of Humanity (PoH) account to your Gitcoin Passport, a process that underscores your verified human identity within the ecosystem. Following these steps will ensure your active participation is recognized and validated.

**Cost:** 0.125 ETH deposit (refundable once the vouching is complete) + gas fees

**Time:** Approximately 3 - 5 days

**Validity:** 90 days&#x20;

**Network:** Ethereum

## Prerequisites

* Ensure you have a Gitcoin Passport. If not, set one up by following the available guide on the Gitcoin website.
* You must have a PoH account linked to the wallet address registered on your Gitcoin Passport. If you haven‚Äôt registered with PoH yet, you can do so on the [Proof of Humanity](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) platform. (Note this will require posting a live video of your face and voice which will be linked to your wallet, if you are uncomfortable with doxxing this information, please choose another stamp).

## How to verify your PoH profile

Please see detailed Proof of Humanity walkthrough on how to recreate a profile and register here: [PoH Tutorial](https://docs.kleros.io/products/proof-of-humanity/proof-of-humanity-tutorial).

Verify that you have a registered PoH profile. You can do this by browsing to [https://app.proofofhumanity.id/](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/). Select the Profiles tab and filter by ‚ÄúRegistered‚Äù. Then proceed to search for your wallet address.

2. Click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù on the Proof of Humanity Stamp card.
3. Click the Account Name checkbox then click Verify.
4. Confirm your account is now verified. You can confirm this by seeing the button that previously read as ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù will now say Verified. Alternatively, [you can inspect the Passport JSON.‚Äã](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-passport/common-questions/how-to-access-your-passport-json)
