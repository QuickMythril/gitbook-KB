**Time:** 5 minutes

**Validity:** 90 days&#x20;

## Prerequisites

* An Ethereum based wallet with notable on-chain activity, as assessed by [Trusta Labs](https://www.trustalabs.ai/).

## How Does it Work

Trusta Labs‚Äô TrustScan tool analyzes your on-chain activity for patterns indicative of sybil attacks, assigning a Sybil Score based on this analysis. Gitcoin Passport uses this score to determine eligibility for the Trusta Labs Stamp. For a deeper understanding of the Sybil Score and its implications, refer to the [Trust Labs‚Äô Q\&A](https://trusta-labs.gitbook.io/trustalabs/trustscan/q-and-a-for-sybil-score) section.

Should you have questions not covered by the Q\&A, we encourage you to engage with  the[ Sybil QA Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1049559726419083294/1136589461514354830/1141589898843926640) on Trusta Labs‚Äô Discord for personalized assistance.

Please Note: The MEDIA score for Zksync wallets differs from the Sybil Score.
