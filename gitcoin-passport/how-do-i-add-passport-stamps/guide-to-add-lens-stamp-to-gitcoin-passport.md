# ðŸ”Œ Guide to Add Lens Stamp to Gitcoin Passport

Gitcoin Passport recognizes your Lens Handle for verification points, not your Lens Profile.

## What is a Lens Profile?

A Lens Profile is your account on Lens, like a profile on other social networks. [More about Lens Profile](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/profile).

## How to Get a Lens Handle:

You can create a Lens Handle if you're part of the Lens beta or you can buy one from others, typically via NFT marketplaces.

## Where to Get Your Handle:

The official way is through the [Lens Claim Portal](https://claim.lens.xyz/). You can also acquire Handles on marketplaces like OpenSea, but ensure you're buying a Handle, not just a Profile.

## Steps to Verify:

1. Claim or purchase a Lens Handle.
2. Connect the Ethereum account of your Passport with your Handle.
3. Verify your Handle on Gitcoin Passport.

Note: There might be a delay after claiming your Handle before you can verify it.
