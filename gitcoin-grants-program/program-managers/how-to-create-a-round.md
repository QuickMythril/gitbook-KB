### Overview

Manager is where you can create and manage rounds. As a round operator, you can manage high-impact grant programs and distribute funds across different rounds and voting mechanisms.\

### Part 1: Create Your Program üé®

Before you can create a round, you must create a program. A program is a container, there can be multiple rounds with unique criteria in each program.

#### Steps:

1. Visit the [Manager site](https://manager.gitcoin.co/) and connect your wallet.&#x20;

1. Once you are connected, click ‚ÄúCreate Program‚Äù.

1. Name your program and add round operators.

_Round Operators are people who will have access to the program and related permissions. You cannot add additional operators after the round is created. If you need to remove a wallet, there is a solution to remove it, but the transaction fees can end up being up to $1,000 USD_\


1.  Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù and sign the transaction.\

### Part 2: Create A Round üí∞

Now that you have a program, you may create your first round within the program.

#### Steps:

1. Name your round.

_Note: Your Round chain cannot be changed, all rounds inherit the chain of their Program._\


1. Define support channels for your round.\

2. Define your dates for the Applications and Round voting periods.
   * The application period is the length of time grantees are given to apply to the Round. The Round voting period is the length of time donors can donate to the round. **Note that under no circumstance** **can grantees be added to the round after the round starts** (even if the application and voting periods overlap).\

3.  **Edit your Quadratic Funding settings.**\

    \
    Here you will add the relevant information for quadratic funding, including your payout token and the available matching funds. You also have the option to add a matching cap, which puts a limit on how much of the matching pool a single grant can receive. This feature is useful if you want to ensure funds are distributed amongst a larger amount of grants.\

4. Click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù in the bottom right-hand corner.
5. Add your Round description and requirements.

Your description and requirements are what grantees will see when they apply to the round, so try to provide as much relevant information as possible. \
\
_Note: Requirements do not restrict who can apply to the round, rather they define who will be accepted. In other words, you cannot prohibit someone from applying based on the requirements, anyone with the link can apply. However, you can manually choose to accept the grantees that fit your requirements._\


1. Click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù in the bottom right-hand corner.
2. Define the information you will require from grantees.
   *   The first box, ‚ÄúProject Information‚Äù, is information that will be collected from grantees by default. Some of the information is mandatory, while other info is optional.\


       <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
   * However, you can configure the application. Every applicant must provide a payout address, but the rest is optional. You may add to or edit the existing list. You also have the option to make questions required/optional or to make results encrypted/unencrypted. If a question is encrypted, the responses can only be viewed by Round Operators with access to that Round.
3.  Click ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù and sign the transaction.\*\

    \
    This may take some time, be patient!

**\*Important Note:** _**Make sure that you have enough ETH (or L2 tokens) in your wallet to deploy all three smart contracts simultaneously, otherwise the round won't be deployed and ETH will be lost, and you will need to restart the process.**_

### Part 3: View Your Round In Explorer üî≠

Once you have launched your Round, you can click ‚ÄúView on Explorer‚Äù
